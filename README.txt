Data Files and Column Descriptions
CommonGarden_Data_With_ENV.csv : File containing quantitative trait and environmental data on the species Q. rubra from 2019. This dataset includes data from 8 populations and 102 maternal lines dispersed across 4 blocks of latitude and longitude coordinates.Column description of variables used in analysis:
Block: Block where the individual tree was locatedLatitude: Latitude of collection siteGermited: Binary variable for whether the acorn germinated or not (1/0)Height_Growth_Rate: Plant stem height growth during entire growing season Mean_Annual_Temp: Mean annual temperature for each individual coordinateTemperature_Seasolity: temperature seasonality for each individual coordinatePrecipitation_of_Wettest_Month: precipitation of wettest month for each individual coordinateStatistical Analysis
This study focused on concepts covered in modules 1-3 in order to analyze this environmental impact. Linear mixed-effects models were utilized to demonstrate the impact of these four environmental variables on the height growth rate of oak trees. The Block variable is also considered as the random effect to account for variation between individual locations. Likelihood ratio tests were performed on all models demonstrating that all four variables had a statistically significant impact on the growth rate of oak trees in 2019. 

Model selection was completed using AIC and BIC values to identify the model with the best fit. The model selection results identified GrowthMod7 to be the best fitting model for height growth rate GrowthMod7 had two fixed effects: latitude and precipitation of wettest month and one random effect: Block.Once the most significant and best fitting model had been identified, further statistical analysis was performed to assess the environmental impact on acorns/oak trees. A second analysis was done on the impact of these environmental factors on the germination. Welch two sample t-test were performed to test for significance. All variables were found to be significant, and the relationships were plotted using a boxplot.
